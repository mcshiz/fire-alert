# Fire Alert

I started this project to refresh some of my skills with creating full javascript 
applications.

Here I am using Node/Express as the backend server where I've created a handful of API 
endpoints for running the front-end.

For Database management I chose to use Sequelize instead of Bookself to learn something new.
Both are very similar ORMs.

For the front end I chose to use React with Redux and React Router v4.
I chose to use React-Router v4 but in hind-sight I see that there are still a handful of bugs
or architecture hurdles that need to be overcome before choosing this for a production app.
